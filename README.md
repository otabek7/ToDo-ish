<h1> Welcome to ToDo-ish! </h1>

<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>ToDo-ish is an app dedicated to serving your busy day. As hard-working people we have tons of duties, and it may not be a good idea trying to store all of it in your head.</p>
<p>Thus, use ToDo-ish to your advantage! A simple yet effective todo app.</p>

<h3>What's up with the name?</h3>
<p>Well, there are 2 reasons.</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Whenever you randomly remember that you need to email Jeff in the middle of a workout, you are most likely NOT going to write it down on a sticky note. 
        It's a task, but you did NOT write it down! As a result, it becomes a "todo-ish"; an item that ~mayyy~ or may not be completed on time.
    </li>
    <li>
        In a language that I speak, Uzbek, the word "ish" defines "a task/job". Since this is a to-do app where all of your tasks get written, I thought "why not translate the word to another language?"
    </li>
</ol>
